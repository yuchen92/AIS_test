## Problem

A website uses Captchas on a form to keep the web-bots away. However, the captchas it generates, are quite similar each time. You are provided a set of twenty-five captchas, such that, each of the characters A-Z and 0-9 occur at least once in one of the Captchas' text. From these captchas, you can identify texture, nature of the font, spacing of the font, morphological characteristics of the letters and numerals, etc.

## Objective

Create a simple AI model or algorithm to identify the unseen captchas based on provided sample set.
